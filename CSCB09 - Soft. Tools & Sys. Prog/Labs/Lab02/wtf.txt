The reason why the data is different is due to new characters being added,
in particular, \r \n are added in certain places. Thus the data representations
of these files are different. (Not to mention the difference in file sizes!)

This can be seen by running:
od -c hello-unix
od -c hello-windows

to compare the data in char format.

Windows appends each newline with a \r (carriage return)
and a \n (newline) b/c of the devices it was meant to be
used for, typewriters! (Source: Ryan Auge, Best TA)

Naturally, sh doesn't understand this syntax and throws
a syntax error.
